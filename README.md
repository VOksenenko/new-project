3. Give your new repository a name (e.g. "new-project") and a brief description if desired. Leave all other settings at their default values and click on "Create repository".
4. Navigate to the directory where you want to store your local copy of the repository using the command line interface.
5. Initialize a new Git repository in that directory by running the following command: git init
6. Add the newly created GitHub repository as the remote origin for your local Git repository by running the following command: git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/new-project.git
7. Create a new branch called "development" and switch to it by running the following command: git checkout -b development
8. Create a new file called "README.md" in your local repository directory by running the following command: touch README.md
9. Open the "README.md" file in a text editor and add the step-by-step instructions for creating a new GitHub repository and creating a development branch.
